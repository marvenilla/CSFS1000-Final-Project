Fans can express their opinions, share their thoughts, and connect with the vast community of fellow enthusiasts.

Detailed summaries and explanations for these characters offer a deeper understanding of the storyline for true fans.

Furthermore, while the "Theories and Discussion" feature is under development and coming soon, users can already create accounts, interact, and engage with one another.
